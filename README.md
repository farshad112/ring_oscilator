# ring_oscillator
Parameterized ring oscillator design in verilog. A simple testbench is developed using SystemVerilog. The test is performed by comparing measured and expected frequency computed using the equation: f= 1/(2*t*n). where n= number of stage of inverter and t= delay of a single inverter.
